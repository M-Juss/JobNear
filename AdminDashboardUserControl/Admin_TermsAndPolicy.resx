    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Welcome to JobNear, our job tracking application. These Terms and Conditions govern the use of our platform. By accessing or using this application, you agree to these terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.

1. Governing Law and Compliance 
	These terms and your use of the platform are governed by the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. Users (job-seekers or job-posters) agree to comply with applicable Philippine laws, including but not limited to labor, privacy, and anti-discrimination statutes

2. Equal Opportunity &amp; Non-Discrimination
2.1 Prohibited Discrimination
Employers posting jobs via the Platform must not discriminate in hiring, terms of employment, compensation, promotion, benefits or any employment condition on the basis of sex, gender, age, disability, or other protected characteristic.
In particular, discrimination based on sex is prohibited under Republic Act 6725, which amended the Labor Code to forbid paying lesser wages or providing fewer benefits to women for work of equal value.
Discrimination on the basis of age is prohibited under Republic Act 10911 (Anti-Age Discrimination in Employment Act). It prohibits job ads or hiring practices that impose arbitrary age limits or preferences, or treat applicants unfairly based on age.
Discrimination against qualified persons with disabilities is prohibited under Republic Act 7277 (Magna Carta for Disabled Persons), as amended by Republic Act 10524 — private and public employers may not deny employment, compensation, benefits, or opportunities solely due to disability.
2.2 Job Posting &amp; Hiring Transparency
All job listings on the Platform must include clear and complete information: company/employer name; job title and description; required qualifications; work location; employment type (full-time, part-time, contractual, remote, etc.); work schedule or shift details if applicable; compensation or salary range; benefits (statutory and other); and other material working conditions (e.g. travel requirements, shift rotation, required certifications).
Employers must not conceal or omit material job requirements or conditions that are likely to affect a candidate’s decision to apply or accept a job offer.
Employers must ensure that job ads do not include unlawful or discriminatory conditions (e.g. specifying age, gender, disability-based exclusion) except when permitted by law (e.g. bona fide occupational qualification).

3. Data Privacy and Handling of Personal Information
The Platform and its users shall comply with Republic Act 10173 (Data Privacy Act of 2012) when processing personal data of job-seekers or employers. 
Personal information collected must be processed in accordance with the law’s principles: collected for specified, legitimate purposes; processed fairly and lawfully; kept accurate and up-to-date; not excessive relative to the processing purpose; stored only as long as necessary for those purposes.
Sensitive data (if any) must be handled with heightened security, confidentiality, and if required — explicit consent. The Platform will implement reasonable measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.

4. Employer Obligations &amp; Representations
The ad and the recruitment process will comply with all applicable Philippine anti-discrimination laws (e.g. RA 6725, RA 10911, RA 7277 / RA 10524).
The job listing is honest, accurate, and not misleading; all material terms and conditions are clearly disclosed.
The employer will not require job seekers to pay any fee, deposit, or other consideration in exchange for consideration or employment.
For disabled applicants, the employer will provide reasonable accommodations and equal opportunity, consistent with the anti-discrimination laws.

5. Reporting Violations &amp; Enforcement
Users (job-seekers or third parties) may report job listings or businesses that appear to violate these Terms (e.g. discriminatory, misleading, or incomplete ads).
Upon receipt of a report, we may review and — at our discretion — suspend, remove, or block offending job ads or accounts.
We may also cooperate with relevant Philippine authorities (e.g. Department of Labor and Employment — DOLE) if necessary, especially in cases of suspected legal violations (e.g. unlawful discrimination).

6. Changes to Terms
We may revise these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on the Platform with a revised date. Continued use of the Platform after posting constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
